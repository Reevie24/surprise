        <p><strong>Anime: What Does The Fox Say? </strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>That's right Foxy, the ultimate-waifu in this list, the ultimate-waifu in the whole industry is <em>you</em>
        my friend.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Foxy is kind, Foxy is smart, but most of all, Foxy is USSR Soviet Russia Communism. Our glorious leader Foxy will lead
        us to victory in the war against the facists in power who live by the rule of capitalism. The power Foxy has is incredible -
         with one slice at your neck Foxy will decapitate you and then inherits all of your finances. It is a truly remarkable
        power.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But for real though - Foxy is the type of person who will without a doubt help you whenever possible. It doesn't matter what the issue
        is because he will always help a friend whenever he can. Foxy is the type of person who looks out for everyone,
        his presence is like a beacon of light in this dull dark world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I just wanted to take my time with this and say that you are truly one amazing person. I know that things have
        been rough for you in the past, and it's going to get rough in the future too because that's just life, but it's okay because you know you've
        always got me and others to be by your side. You've helped me so much from when we first met so I will always be there when needed my dude.</p>
