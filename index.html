        <h1 id="intro-title">Hello Foxy</h1>
        <p>I hope you are doing well buddy throughout this lockdown. I know it's been hard and all but I hope you and the family
        are safe and sound - give my love to Manal.</p>
        <p>Okay now that I have gotten the formalities are out of the way;</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>FUCK YOU</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>You must be wondering to yourself <em>"woah woah woah where did that come from?!"</em> well buckaroo let me tell you
        this was a long time coming! ;)</p>
        <p>Remember a while ago - specifically the <strong><em><u>30th May</u></em></strong> we had a conversation that shook me
        to my core. It really ruffled my feathers. Do you remember? Because <em>I do</em>.</p>
        <p><em>"But Mattie, what conversation do you speak off oh great and wise honorable fellow being?" (Totally what you're
        thinking)</em> WELL I AM TALKING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION FOXY. THE <strong>CONVERSATION</strong></p>
        <h1><strong>HOW DARE YOU SAY MISATO IS A BETTER WAIFU THAN SHICHIMIYA!</strong></h1>
        <p>Those words <em>haunt</em> me. I wake up at night in fear over those words.</p>
        <p>So this website is designed to prove to you that you are <strong>wrong</strong> and to also help me develop my web
        development skills because I learnt one of the main things and I need to test and keep working on it into me brains and
        thought 'fuck it why not make this site' <strong>but that's not the issue right now</strong>!</p>
