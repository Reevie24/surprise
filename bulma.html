        <p><strong>Anime: Dragon Ball Series</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Before I start I just wanna say it's really creepy how when you search for Bulma gifs in google it comes up
        with a lot of lewd stuff.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway so back to the waifu, Bulma is definitely a waifu to have on this list. I mean she's as smart as anything,
        she knows what she wants and isn't a pushover. She's a very strong character who you do not want to fuck around with.
        That being said, if you stick to her good side, then she really is a lovely character.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She's the CEO of Capsule corp which means she's got dollar dollar so you wouldn't even need a job! You could just
        casually cruise and leech off of her empire which, hey I won't judge.</p>
