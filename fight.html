    <!-- Explanation -->
    <div id="fight-explanation">
        <p>So this page is dedicated to unearthing the most <em>difficult</em> question of all time...</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Who is the ultimate <strong>waifu</strong> and <strong>best girl</strong> out of <strong>Shichimiya</strong>
            or <strong>Misato</strong>?</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Well look no further! Because this will tell you!</p>

        <h1>Magical Devil Girl - Satone Shichimiya</h1>
        <p><strong>Anime: Love, Chuunibiyou & Other Delusions</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Shichimiya is a strong and sensible character. She gives great advice to her friends and companions and oozes wisdom.
        When she looses her purse that one time she doesn't give up at all - she looks for it which shows determination. It shows
        leadership and it shows her strong will. She also goes out on adventures to fight the the supernatural which shows she's kind-hearted
        as she's fighting to protect us all. Unlike Misato, bitch sits back and lets kids do it, <strong><em>KIDS!</em></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>She's also a gAMeR GiRL as she has multiple consoles. Does Misato? <strong>NO!</strong>
        When ever she is sad, it hits you right in your feels because <strong>SHE. IS. AN.</strong><s> magicaldevilgirl</s><strong> ANGEL!</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Is Shichimiya drinking alcohol whilst taking care of 2 teenagers AND a penguin? NO! Because Shichimiya is not a bad influence to others
        and she knows that is morally <strong>WRONG</strong> <em>(and well she also doesn't have teenagers or a penguin BUT IF SHE DID SHE WOULDN'T).</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Shichimiya is the type of person who would be the designated driver and not have drink because she knows she has a <strong>responsibility</strong>
        to get the others home. She's also the type of person to help you to your door or even tuck you in bed and leave a bucket by your side. Would
        Misato do that? Fuck no she's the type of person to laugh and tell you keep on drinking!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shichimiya looks after people. She doesn't throw <strong>14 YEAR OLD KIDS INTO DANGER</strong> which could <strong>KILL THEM</strong> like Misato
        does. She would never sit back and watch whilst others are fighting for her, she would totally step up and help the teenagers. She also knows
        it's wrong to kiss minors Foxy.</p>

    <!-- Misato -->
    <div id="misato-text">
        <h1>Misato "I hate daddy" Katsuragi</h1>
        <p><strong>Anime: Neon Genesis Evangelion</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Misato is - in some way a strong character as well, she's got skills when handling a gun and her military direction
        does pay off and helps throughout the movies. Her role in the series is definitely considered a respecatable role for
        that calibre and her promotion shows her dedication to the cause.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I will also admit she does have a kind heart for taking
        in Shitji and Assuka when no one else would. She also has a pet penguin and shows <strong>SOME</strong> responsibility in the movie by deciding to
        send Pen-Pen off for safety. That shows the strength of the character.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However unfortunately they are the only good points that I can say - and even those points have major flaws to them. For starters
        lets work with the <em>kind heart</em> for taking in Shitji and Assuka. Whilst it's admirable that she has done that I find it highly
        inappropriate to do so when she cannot even take care of herself. It's highly irresponsible too and not only can it cause stress for her
        but it can cause absolutely dire psychological trauma (<strong>which it DOES</strong>) for the teenagers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that's not all for this shit-brigade on Misato - <em>"Oh but Mattie it's still decent of her to take them in and show compassion and
        respect to them when noone else would"</em> - <strong>BULLSHIT</strong>!</p>
        <br>
        <p>How can someone be so kind and yet place two teenagers who <strong>CLEARLY HAVE INNER DEMONS
        AND SELF-HATE</strong> in life threatening situations to destroy aliens. I mean seriously? She met Shitji like an hour ago before taking him to fight.
        I bet she only took them in to manipulate them and guilt-trip them into doing it as she knew how mentally fucked up they were.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She also kisses minors too! Ew. She coddles the kids, makes them cook for her cause she a lazy hoe and has commitment issues. I mean
        she broke up with her boyfriend because he reminded her of her dad and then tried to get back with him? What is she? 12?</p>
        <br>
        <p>No mention of gaming either.</p>
