        <p><strong>Anime: The Rising Of The Shield Hero</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Raphtalia is one of the few anime characters I have seen on Reddit where people get genuinely upset and angry if you
        try and lewd her. That's because she's SO FECKIN <em>PRECIOUS</em>!</p>
        <br>
        <p>She is such a sweetie, she will never abandon her friends and will always look out for them. She's lived an incredibly
        hard life and yet look at her now, fighting against the evil monsters protecting those who want to harm her. <em>(sure she kinda has
        to because of the slave crest BUT SHE WANTS TO WHICH IS THE MAIN POINT!).</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Now even though she's a sweetie, she is a badass and you do not want to get on her bad side. She will cut you up if you
        diss her friends. You have been warned.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Plus she's part raccoon so.. I guess if you're into animals that's a plus? I mean look at that fluff-ball of a tail.</p>
